## Question

Predation risk has received theoretical treatments under the broad non - consumptive effects frame-
work. However, the role of habitat characteristics has not revived much attention. To our
knowledge, none of the models explicitly consider spatial dynamics. We aim to understand how the spatial
distributions and densities of the prey population and vegetation change as a function of predation risk
perceived by the prey.

## Usage

The code is anotated. Runs best with Anaconda 3 distribution. Please excute ```pip install ray``` in your conda environment before running the code. Average execution time 1 - 2 hours.

## Software Used

Python 3.8 with numpy, ray libraries
